%%  Printouts can be left in the bin outside my door. 

%%  For this assignment, you should provide Prolog facts and
%%  rules for the following predicates.  To facilitate your
%%  work, some facts and rules have been provided for you.

%%  NOTE:  Your code should be nicely formatted, with adequate
%%         comments.  Long lines should NOT wrap around!!

%%  1.  Prerequisites for CMPU courses at Vassar
%% -----------------------------------------------

%%  prereqs(+C,Pre) 
%% ------------------------------------------
%%  holds if Pre is the list of pre-requisite courses for the course C

%%  Note:  The desired info is available from AskBanner.
%%         For this asmt, we only care about the pre-reqs that are CS courses.
%%         Don't worry about "recommended" courses, Math courses, etc.

%%  Sample facts/rules:

%%  offered(+C,+Sem)   <=== facts and rules provided for you below
%% -----------------------------------------------------------------
%%  holds if the course C is offered in the semester Sem
%% -----------------------------------------------------------------
%%  Define in terms of the following helper predicates:
%%    offeredList(C,Sems) -- holds if C is offered during the listed semseters
%%      Example:  offeredList(cs245,[2,3,7]).

%% Courses that are offered every semester.

offered(cs101,_S).
offered(cs102,_S).
offered(cs145,_S).
offered(cs203,_S).
offered(cs224,_S).
offered(cs240,_S).
offered(cs241,_S).

%% Courses that are offered *sometimes*

%% Note:  Facts of the form, offeredList(C,Sems) are used to represent
%%        that the course C is offered during the semesters listed in
%%        Sems.  See examples below.

offered(C,Sem) :-
  offeredList(C,Sems),
  member(Sem,Sems).

%%  Note:  The following course-offering info is not intended to accurately
%%         reflect actual course offerings at Vassar, but it is close enough
%%         for our purposes.

%%  200 electives

offeredList(cs235,[1,4]).
offeredList(cs245,[2,3,7]).
offeredList(cs250,[5,6,8]).

%%  300 required

offeredList(cs379,[3,7]).


%%  2. canTake
%% -----------------------------------------------

%%  canTake(+C,+PrevCourses,+Sem)
%% -----------------------------------------------
%%  holds if the course C is offered during the semester Sem, and 
%%  PrevCourses contains all the prerequisites for C.

%%  Note:  If C is a 300-level course, it can only be taken if
%%         PrevCourses includes at least two 200-level courses.

%%  To help with this latter requirement, define facts/rules for the 
%%  following helper predicates:
%%    2a.  lowerLevel(C) -- holds if C is a 100-level or 200-level course
%%    2b.  midLevel(C) -- holds if C is a 200-level course
%%    2c.  atLeastNTwos(N,PrevCourses) -- holds if PrevCourses contains
%%                at least N 200-level courses.

%%  Then the additional requirement for taking a 300-level course 
%%  can be expressed as:
%%    "if C is a 300-level course, then PrevCourses must contain at
%%        least two 200-level courses"
%%  which is equivalent to:
%%    "either C is a lower-level course (100-level or 200-level)
%%     *OR* PrevCourses must contain at least 2 200-level courses"

%%  (Hint:  How is "disjunction" (i.e., OR) represented in Prolog syntax?)

%% Checks if course C is a lower level course
lowerLevel(C) :- member(C, [cs101,cs102,cs145,cs203,cs224,cs235,cs240,cs241,cs245,cs250]).

%% Checks if course C is a 200 level course
midLevel(C) :- member(C, [cs203,cs224,cs235,cs240,cs241,cs245,cs250]).

%% Checks if PrevCourses contains at least N 200 level courses
atLeastNTwos(0, _PrevCourses).
atLeastNTwos(N,PrevCourses) :-
    %% there is a midlevel course C that is in PrevCourses
    midLevel(C),
    member(C, PrevCourses),
    %% remove course C from PrevCourses and decrement the number
    %% of 200s that are still needed before recursive call
    delete(PrevCourses, C, RestC),
    NDec is N -1,
    atLeastNTwos(NDec, RestC).

canTake(C, PrevCourses, Sem) :-
    %% if C is a lower level:
    lowerLevel(C),
    %% check that it is currently offered and the prereqs have been taken
    offered(C, Sem),
    prereqs(C, Cs),
    subset(Cs,PrevCourses).

canTake(C, PrevCourses, Sem) :-
    %% if C is not a lower level:
  \+lowerLevel(C),
    %% need at least 2 200 level courses
    atLeastNTwos(2, PrevCourses),
    %% check that it is currently offere and the prereqs have been taken
    offered(C, Sem),
    prereqs(C, Cs),
    subset(Cs,PrevCourses).

%%  3.  selectCourse
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------

%%  selectCourse(-C, +PrevCourses, +CoursesLeft, -RemCourses, +Sem)
%% --------------------------------------------------------------
%%  holds if C is a course that can be taken during semester Sem,
%%  given that the courses listed in PrevCourses have already been
%%  taken.  C must be drawn from CoursesLeft.  RemCourses is what
%%  remains after removing C from CoursesLeft.  (See "select" from the
%%  map-coloring code.)

selectCourse(C,PrevCourses,CoursesLeft,RemCourses,Sem) :-
    %% if course C can be taken:
    canTake(C, PrevCourses, Sem),
    %% remove C from Courses Left
    delete(CoursesLeft, C, RemCourses).


%%  4.  incrementally fleshing out a full schedule
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------

%%  fillSched(+PrevSched, +PrevCourses, +CurrCourses, +MaxPer, +CoursesLeft,
%%                        +Sem, -FullSched)
%% --------------------------------------------------------------------
%%  holds if the current partial schedule can be fleshed out into a
%%  full schedule that satisfies the C.S. major. 
%% --------------------------------------------------------------------
%%  PrevSched is a list containing info about the courses taken in 
%%    each of the prior semesters.  Each element of PrevSched has the
%%    form N/Cs, where N is the number of the semester (1 <= N <= 8), 
%%    and Cs is the list of courses taken in that semester 
%%    (e.g., [cs102,cs145]));
%%  PrevCourses is a *flat* list of *all* the C.S. courses from *all*
%%    of the semesters included in PrevSched (e.g., [cs101,cs102,cs145]);
%%  CurrCourses are the C.S. courses that are being scheduled (so far)
%%    for the current semester (Sem);
%%  MaxPer is an upper bound on the number of C.S. courses that can be
%%    taken during any one semester (e.g., MaxPer might be 3);
%%  CoursesLeft are the C.S. courses that the student has not yet
%%    scheduled that are needed to complete the major;
%%  Sem is the semester number (1-8); and
%%  FullSched is the resulting full schedule (typically not known until
%%    until the very end).

%%  Note:  A partial schedule can be incrementally fleshed out
%%         in the following ways:
%%   (1) If possible, select a course to add to CurrCourses for this 
%%         semester.  (Recursive goal will stay in this semester.)
%%   (2) Move to the next semester.  (Recursive goal will involve 
%%         appending Sem/CurrCourses to the PrevSched.)
%%   (3) The current semester is 9, indicating that semesters 1-8 are
%%         included in PrevSched, which means that you're done.
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------------
%% (1) is not possible if you've already scheduled MaxPer courses for
%%     the current semester, or there's no course that you're able
%%     to add to the current semester because of pre-reqs.
%% (2) is not possible if the number of courses left is too big to
%%     fit into the remaining semesters.  (For example, if there
%%     are 8 courses left, but only 2 semesters left, and MaxPer = 3,
%%     then there's not enough room left to schedule the remaining
%%     courses.  Including this constraint will make the search for 
%%     a solution faster.)
%% (3) is not allowed if CoursesLeft is not empty, among other things.

%% Case (1): can still take more CS classes

fillSched(PrevSched, PrevCourses, CurrCourses, MaxPer, CoursesLeft, Sem, FullSched) :-
  %% if haven't reached max number of CS courses
  length(CurrCourses, Lngth),
  Lngth < MaxPer,
  %% attempt to select a course C from CoursesLeft
  member(C, CoursesLeft),
  selectCourse(C, PrevCourses, CoursesLeft, RemCourses, Sem),
  %% if a course was found that can be taken recursive call with C added to the 
  %% courses currently being taken
  fillSched(PrevSched, PrevCourses, [C|CurrCourses], MaxPer, RemCourses, Sem, FullSched).

%% Case (2): can't take anymore CS courses because either takeing the max number of courses
%% or don't have the prereqs for any other courses

fillSched(PrevSched, PrevCourses, CurrCourses, MaxPer, CoursesLeft, Sem, FullSched) :-
  %% check if possible to complete number of classes left in remaining semesters
  length(CoursesLeft, N),
  RemSems is (8 - Sem),
  N =< MaxPer * RemSems,
  %% increment semester
  NextSem is (Sem + 1),
  %% add the courses taken during Sem to PrevCourses
  append(CurrCourses,PrevCourses,TotalCourses),
  %% recursive call with Sem/Courses added to PrevSched, new PrevCourses, CurrCourses set to
  %% the empty set
  fillSched([Sem/CurrCourses|PrevSched], TotalCourses, [], MaxPer, CoursesLeft, NextSem , FullSched).
  
  %%  Here's case (3), done for you!

fillSched(PrevSched, _PrevCourses, [], _MaxPer, [], 9, FullSched) :-
  %% Since accumulating schedule in a list, it comes out backwards;
  %% so, need to reverse it
  reverse(PrevSched,FullSched),
  %% Hey, let's print it out nicely!  (printSemester defined below)
  maplist(printSemester,FullSched).


%% ---------------------------------------------------------------
%%  Some additional facts/rules to help you out.
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------

%%  printSemester(+Sched)
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------
%%  always succeeds.  causes the Sched for *one* semester to be 
%%  printed out nicely.  assumes Sched has the form:  N/Courses.
%%  For example, Sched might be:  1/[cs101].  Another example:
%%  2/[cs102,cs145].

printSemester(N/Courses) :-
  format('Semester ~w: ~w \n', [N,Courses]).

%%  "Wrapper predicate" to facilitate testing:

%%  makeSched(+MaxPer,+TwoElec,+ThrElecA,+ThrElecB,-FullSched)
%% ---------------------------------------------------------------
%%  holds if there is a FullSched of courses (over 8 semesters)
%%  that satisfies the C.S. major requirements, as follows:
%%   MaxPer = max number of CS courses in any single semester
%%   TwoElec = one of cs235, cs245, cs250
%%   ThrElecA = one of the 300-level electives
%%   ThrElecB = another of the 300-level electives

makeSched(MaxPer,TwoElec,ThrElecA,ThrElecB,FullSched) :-
  member(TwoElec,[cs235,cs245,cs250]),
  subset([ThrElecA,ThrElecB],[cs324,cs325,cs353,cs365,cs366,cs375,cs376,
           cs377,cs378,cs379]),
  %%  We assemble the list of courses as follows to make the search
  %%  go faster.  Note that the courses need not be scheduled in this
  %%  order, but the actual order will probably not deviate too much
  %%  from this
  ListyOne = [cs101,cs102,cs145,cs203,cs224,cs240,cs241],
  ListyTwo = [TwoElec,cs331,cs334,ThrElecA,ThrElecB],
  append(ListyOne,ListyTwo,Listy),
  %%  Here's the call to "fillSched" with suitably initialized arguments
  %%  Notice that PrevSched = PrevCourses = CurrCourses = []
  %%  Listy = the full list of courses needed to satisfy the major
  %%  FullSched won't be instantiated until the entire goal succeeds.
  fillSched([],[],[],MaxPer,Listy,1,FullSched).

%%  Here's an example:

%% ?- makeSched(3,cs245,cs365,cs377,FullSched).
%% Semester 1: [cs101]          <--- These 8 lines are side-effect printing
%% Semester 2: [cs145,cs102]
%% Semester 3: [cs240,cs224,cs203]
%% Semester 4: [cs331,cs241]
%% Semester 5: [cs334]
%% Semester 6: []
%% Semester 7: [cs377,cs245]
%% Semester 8: [cs365]                        
%% FullSched = [1/[cs101], 2/[cs145, cs102], 3/[cs240, cs224, cs203], 
%%              4/[cs331, cs241], 5/[cs334], 6/[], 7/[cs377|...], 8/[...]] .

%% The last line "FullSched = ..." is "the answer".  See why we used "maplist"
%% and "printSemester"!


%% =======================================================
%%  TESTING WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF YOUR GRADE!
%% =======================================================
%%  You should include MANY separate tests for EACH of the following predicates
%%  to demonstrate that they work properly when tested in isolation:
%%     prereqs, canTake, selectCourse, fillSched.
%%  For "fillSched", create some tests that start with a full (or nearly
%%  full) schedule.  For example, you might try defining a TESTER predicate
%%  like this:

tester(0,F) :-
  PrevSched = [1/[cs101],2/[cs145,cs102],3/[cs224,cs203],4/[cs235,cs240],
               5/[cs376,cs241],6/[cs366,cs331],7/[cs334],8/[]],

  fillSched(PrevSched, PrevCourses, [], 2, [], 9, F).

%%  Other test cases can be constructed similarly (using a first argument that
%%  is a different number).  That way, at the command line, you can just type:
%%  tester(0,F) instead of the whole big mess above.

tester(0,F) :-
  PrevSched = [1/[cs101],2/[cs145,cs102],3/[cs224,cs203],4/[cs235,cs240],

  fillSched(PrevSched, PrevCourses, [], 2, [], 8, F).

%%  You should define MANY such test expressions for fillSched.

%%  When everything appears to be working, *then* you should define SEVERAL
%%  MORE test expressions for makeSched.

%%  As described in asmt8-template.txt, you should define an "output"
%%  predicate that generates all of your test results in a nicely formatted
%%  manner.  And you should generate an output file that you will include
%%  in your electronic submission, and that you will print out.  See
%%  "asmt8-template.txt" for more details.

%%  HINTS:  If testPrereqs takes two arguments (e.g., cs101 and Cs)
%%          you can use:  maplist(testPrereqs,[cs101,cs353,cs366],_Listy)
%%    Listy represents the list of answers (each element being a list of
%%    prereqs for one of the given courses).

%%    Run "output." at the prolog query to test your "output" predicate.
%%    You don't have to create an output file every time you test; only
%%    at the end, when you're done.
